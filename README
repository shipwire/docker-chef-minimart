This container installs default localhost port 8081 Minimart and configures it based on our own inventory file.

If you want to use your own inventory and URL create a custom image based on this one or use it as an example.
This is a good solution for cases when api.bercksehlf is not accessable. 

Original instructions and sources of minimart can be found here
